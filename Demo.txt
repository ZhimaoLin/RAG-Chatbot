          Question
==============================
How to treat it?
==============================

==============================
          Answer
==============================
The treatment for Resistant Hypertension may involve several strategies. It is important to review and reiterate lifestyle measures such as sodium and potassium intake, stress management, exercise, and alcohol moderation. Improving adherence to prescribed medications is also crucial. Additionally, eliminating drugs and substances that may be causing higher blood pressure, such as calcineurin inhibitors, licorice, and erythropoietin, should be considered. Add-on pharmacologic therapy may also be recommended, but specific medications would depend on the individual's condition and should be determined by a healthcare professional.

==============================
Then, what is the cause of it?
==============================

==============================
          Answer
==============================
The cause of resistant hypertension can vary from person to person. Some possible causes include medication nonadherence, white coat effect (elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting), and treatment inertia (failure to adjust or change medication). Other causes can include underlying medical conditions or secondary hypertension. It is important to consult with a hypertension 
specialist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

          Question
==============================
What is the threshold of the RHT diagnose?
==============================

==============================
          Answer
==============================
Based on the provided information, the blood pressure thresholds for diagnosing resistant hypertension are as follows:

- For individuals with diabetes: Systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 130 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than 80 mm Hg.
- For individuals at high cardiovascular risk: Systolic BP greater than 120 mm Hg.
- For individuals of older age: The specific threshold is not mentioned in the given context.

Please note that the thresholds may vary depending on factors such as comorbidities and individual patient characteristics.

          Question
==============================
Does smoking and alchohol affect HTx?
==============================

==============================
          Answer
==============================
Smoking and alcohol consumption can have negative effects on heart transplantation (HTx). They are considered important factors to address in order to reduce vascular complications and increase the success of the transplantation. It is recommended for patients to quit smoking and alcohol consumption to improve their chances of a successful HTx.

==============================
          Answer
==============================
Based on the given context, the exact requirements for heart transplantation are not mentioned. However, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and the Canadian Cardiac Transplant Network 
have published position statements on heart transplantation, which likely outline the eligibility criteria and selection process for patients. To obtain the specific requirements, it would be necessary to refer to the CCS guidelines or consult a medical professional familiar with the current guidelines and criteria for heart transplantation.
